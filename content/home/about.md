# Biography

My research is on the areas of shrimp and fish selective breeding. I am interested in design of genetic improvement programs, development of breeding objectives, selection strategies, and genetic evaluation systems. Currently, my research is focused on estimating genetic parameters for additive, non-additive and indirect genetic effects, predicting selection response, and designing mating scheme for economically important traits in shrimp and fish.

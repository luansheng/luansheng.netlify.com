abstract = "To understand the influence the individual-rearing design will exert on selective breeding programs for feed efficiency trait of L. vannamei, this study assessed the extent of genotype by environment (G × E) interaction for feed efficiency of 15 full-sib families reared in individuals vs. in groups. Feed efficiency ratio (FER), average daily weight gain (ADG) and daily feed intake (DFI) were measured on individuals of the families in individual-rearing condition and on groups of individuals of the same families in group-rearing condition, respectively, with a restricted feeding regime. As the experimental design, each family was divided into three groups in both rearing conditions, and a total of 90 group records were used for G × E analysis. In this study, increased FER and ADG denoted as least squared means were observed in group-rearing condition compared to individual-rearing condition. Genetic variance was much higher than G × E and environmental variances for both FER and ADG, but G × E variance was higher than genetic and environmental variances for DFI. Genetic correlations between the two conditions were 0.786 and 0.909 for FER and ADG, respectively, which indicates a mild G × E interaction effect for FER and an insignificant G × E interaction effect for ADG. These results suggest that for family selection the decisions based on individual-rearing design might be applicable for production situation where shrimp are held in social groups and individual-rearing design is feasible in breeding programs for feed efficiency of L. vannamei."
